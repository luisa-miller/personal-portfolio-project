# Luisa Miller – Final Project - Personal Portfolio

Welcome! I'm **Luisa Miller**, a student developer passionate about designing clean, accessible, and interactive web experiences. I enjoy turning creative ideas into functional code and am always exploring new tools and techniques to grow as a developer.

## About This Project

This portfolio project represents the culmination of my learning journey over the past year. It showcases my growth in front-end development, from understanding HTML/CSS fundamentals to building dynamic projects with JavaScript. Through this project, I’ve gained confidence in responsive design, version control, and deploying web applications. Most importantly, I learned how to structure a development process from concept to completion.

## Portfolio Overview

The site is designed to be simple, responsive, and visually engaging—reflecting both my style and what I’ve learned as a developer.
